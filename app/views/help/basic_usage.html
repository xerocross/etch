Here in a nutshell is how I, the creator of XeroEtch, use it.  You may find other valuable ways to use it.
</p>

<h2>Study and Making Cards</h2>

<p>
Basically, whenever I am reading or studying something I want to commit to memory, I will have Etch open in a computer beside me for making flashcards.  I strongly recommend using a computer with a real keyboard for this.  Of course you can make do with typing on a mobile device, but that will be very tedious, and it may deter you from making as many cards as you should.</p>

<p>For example, then, say I’m reading a book on whales and it says that whales are not fish; they are mammals.  (That  may be common knowledge, but pretend it is something you want to learn and remember.)  Having just read that fact and found it interesting, I will go over to my Etch window and create a flashcard to represent that fact.</p>

<p>For simple declarative statements, the fill-in-the-blank macro works very well.  In the macro, we can type, “The whale is not a fish; it is a ??mammal??.”  The double question mark on either side of ‘mammal’ is what turns that word into a blank.  Note that you could have used the even simpler sentence, “The whale is a ??mammal??.”, but the problem with that is that if you were tested on “The whale is a BLANK”, the question is not suggestive enough.  It’s not clear what kind of information about whales you are being tested on.</p>

<p>A 10 minute study session might result in only one new card or in 15 new cards.  It’s all up to you and how many of the details you want to recall in the future.</p>

<h2>Memorizing New Cards</h2>

<p>After you create new cards, they sit in a kind of limbo waiting for you.  New cards are visible in the Memorize New Cards view in Etch.  For each card in this view, there is only one processing button.  Either you select, “memorized” or you leave it for another day.  Personally, I suggest clicking “memorize” (or the check sign on small screens) when you think you could easily remember the material in that card for at least the next 5-7 days.  That’s all.  Will you remember it 5 days from now?  Then click “memorized”.  After this, the card gets dismissed from the Memorize New Cards view and it goes into spaced review to be repeated at intervals.</p>

<p>How often and when should you study cards in the Memorize New Cards view?  That is entirely up to you.  Those cards will wait for you as long as you need them to wait.</p>


<h2>Review Cards Due</h2>

<p>The real magic happens in reviewing the cards that are due.  When and how frequently do you review each card?  Well, part of the beauty of Etch is that it keeps track of that for you.  All you need to do is log in to Etch every day or so and see if there are any review cards  you need to look at.  If you are a regular Etch user, then it is very likely that you will have a few cards to review each day.</p>

<p>Etch was never conceived of as a quiz program exactly.  There is usually no place for your to enter your answers.  It works like flashcards.  You quiz yourself, check the answer, and you decide for yourself whether your answer was acceptable.</p>

<p>Personally, I like to do my reviews over morning coffee.  If you review the cards due on a daily basis, there will usually only be a few, very little work to do.</p>

<p>If you skip a few days, it’s no big deal.  You might accumulate a somewhat long list of reviews that are due when you come back to Etch, but you don’t have to make it into drudgery.  It’s perfectly acceptable to review just the cards you feel like doing that day and leave the rest for tomorrow or later.  It’s better to do the review well than to just get it over with for the sake of completion.  If a card is due and you do not push one of the buttons indicating that you have reviewed it, then it will stay there in the Cards Due view until you are ready to dismiss it again.  When you click “got it” or the check mark, it will be dismissed until the next review.
